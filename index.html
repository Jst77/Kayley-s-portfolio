            <p>Hello! My name is Kayley Te and I am a 22 year old Illinois native living in Chicago. <br>
                From a young age I always enjoyed going to my biannual dentist appointment and decided very  <br>
               early that I wanted to pursue Dentistry after college. I knew that attending Northwestern Universty <br> 
               would maximize my chances of fulfilling my dreams. I graduated from Northwestern in the Spring of 2021<br>
                with a Bachelors in Biology. After graduation I studied full time for the Dental Admissions Test (DAT) <br>
                and took it in October of 2021 <br>
                <br>
                I will be attending _____ School of Dentistry in the Fall of 2023. In the meantime I will be working full-time<br>
                as a babysitter and nanny.<br> 
                Please reach out to me if you would like to connect on Linkedin!<br>
                </p>
